I know it's tempting try to pack everything but the kitchen sink --but you are the GOAT not a pack mule!

No matter if I choose to travel light and take only carry on (plus the personal item) or break out the heavy duty check-in luggage, my carry on always contains:

* things I need/want to keep close to me (food, entertainment, meds) whether its a short domestic or a long international flight
* things I may need if my check-in luggage is lost (like a change of clothes) or things that maybe expensive, fragile, or hold sentimental value (like tech & jewelry) I don't want to risk possibly never seeing again if my check-in luggage is stolen

So today, I'm sharing my go-to eco-friendly carry on packing list that I use no matter where or for how long I fly. I hope it helps you save some time and effort so you can G.O.A.T. - Get Out And Travel all the way to your next destination.

### Carry On... my wayward son

Luckily there is only a handful of airlines that will not allow economy customers to bring at least 1 regular carry-on bag on board. So most airlines (even the budget ones I'm looking at you Spirit/Frontier) will allow at least one (1) carry on item under their specified weight limit (5-10 kgs or 11-22 lbs). 

Even better, the major airlines usually allow up to two (2) carry on items: 

1. one (1) [carry on spinner luggage](https://amzn.to/3yQXmmN)
2. one (1) personal item (typically a purse, backpack, laptop sleeve, briefcase, or my *personal* favorite (get it 'personal' favorite... ðŸ˜‰) the [A Golf Duffel Bag](https://amzn.to/3B4yj2e) that can be stowed under the seat in front of you).

With this duo, I don't even need a check-in bag sometimes. There's something nice about arriving at your destination and not having to worry if your things got lost or stolen, and you don't have to wait for it to come around the baggage carousel possibly damaged from mishandling or covered in ðŸ’©.

### Backpack, Backpack!

Now while I don't condone using your backpack to store stolen egg roll, no matter how tasty, from the all you can eat Chinese buffet. ðŸ¤£ I do absolute love a versatile backpack that can store all my gear whether it's just clothes for the weekend or expensive tech and camera gear. After years of searching, then another waiting for it be on sale, I finally acquired the [Wandrd PRVKE 21](https://www.wandrd.com/products/prvke?variant=39289416122448). My friends thought it was so nice last time we all vacationed together, two (2) of them recently bought one for themselves. Since I purchased mine (years ago) they've made some improvements.

> Weâ€™ve taken our award-winning PRVKE line and made improvements to features and comfort. We started by updating the back panel and shoulder straps. Implementing new shapes and padding to create a more comfortable, breathable, and versatile carrying experience for all body shapes and sizes.
>
> We updated the Hidden Passport Pocket to be larger and more discreet. We also added a luggage pass-through strap. Other external changes include stronger magnets in the Tote Handles, updated zipper u-pullers, new easier-to-use Key Hook, branding updates, and velcro-and-roll Cinch Strap webbing organization. 
>
> Inside the PRVKE  we updated the laptop/tablet closure system and added 3 new pockets on the laptop/tablet sleeve. 
>
>
> Finally, we removed the liner flap that covered the Camera Cube compartment for quick access to your gear. The perfect bag just got perfect-er.  

The Wandrd PRVKE comes in two sizes the PRVKE 21(L) (Dimensions: 43 X 28 X 17 cm (17"H X 11"W X 6.5"D)) and the PRVKE 31(L) (Dimensions: 48 X 30 X 18 cm (19"H X 12"W X 7"D)). And with the stylish roll top design, by fully extending it you can increase the volume the bag can carry by +5L. I'm sure no matter what size you decide to go with you'll love it. It's a really amazing bag!

### They see me rollin' the hatin'

The dimension limit for a carry on varies with the airline but the standard allowance is 22" high, 14" wide, and 9" deep. I personally use a 20" hard shell aluminum frame spinner with built-in TSA lock and no zippers by Calvin Klein but this [Winbest Aluminum Spinner](https://amzn.to/3cw84Yo) while not an exact match for the CK, it is pretty darn close in both looks and functionality. Since the CK was a gift from my late mother keep it in excellent shape with this [PVC transparent suitcase cover](https://amzn.to/3B4d9RH). It'll also protect all the stickers I plan to cover it with from all my travels. ðŸ˜Š
