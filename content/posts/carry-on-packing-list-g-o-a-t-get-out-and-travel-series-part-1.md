Okay who here gets a little stressed when it's time to pack for a trip? <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2LM1PMisy0Lvo0qmp8/giphy.gif" width="250" height="200" alt="Raise hand gif">  I know it's tempting try to pack everything but the kitchen sink --but you are the GOAT not a pack mule!

No matter if I choose to travel light and take only carry on (plus the personal item) or break out the heavy duty check-in luggage, I the carry on always contains:

* things I need/want to keep close to me (food, entertainment, meds) whether its a short domestic or a long international flight
* things I may need if my check-in luggage is lost (like a change of clothes) or things that maybe expensive, fragile, or hold sentimental value (like tech & jewelry) I don't want to risk possibly never seeing again if my check-in luggage is stolen

So today, I'm sharing my go-to eco-friendly carry on packing list that I use no matter where or for how long I fly. I hope it helps you save some time and effort so you can G.O.A.T. - Get Out And Travel all the way to your next destination. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OqNBIjnudq2D6/giphy.gif" width="250" height="200" alt="Goat riding">

### Carry On... my wayward son

Most airlines (even the budget ones I'm looking at you Spirit/Frontier) will allow at least one (1) carry on item under their specified weight limit (5-10kgs). 

But, If you're lucky, some airlines will allow up to two (2) carry on items: 

1. one (1) carry on luggage 
2. one (1) personal item (typically a purse, backpack, laptop sleeve, briefcase, or my *personal* favorite (get it 'personal' favorite... ðŸ˜‰) the [Amazon Basics Golf Duffel Bag](https://amzn.to/3B4yj2e) that can be stowed under the seat in front of you).
